## Description
This repository contains supporting information and code for the paper _"Role of Imidazolium Cation Hydrophobicity in Ubiquitin Solvation by Aqueous Ionic Liquids"_. The data includes simulations, plots, and tables used for comparison between ionic liquids containing [EMIM]+ and [BMIM]+ cations and their interactions with various anions. The supporting figures and data tables are available below.

## Figures





### Figure S1
Comparison of Minimum-Distance Distribution Functions (MDDFs) and Kirkwood-Buff (KB) integrals for ionic liquid systems containing [EMIM]+ and [BMIM]+ cations with various anions. Panels A and D compare the cations [EMIM]+ and [BMIM]+; panels B and E compare [BF4]- anions paired with [EMIM]+ and [BMIM]+; and panels C and F compare [Cl]- anions paired with [EMIM]+ and [BMIM]+.

### Notes:
- Make sure you place the figures in a `figures/` directory.
- Replace `"path_to_your_csv_file.csv"` with the actual path to your CSV files.
- You can adapt the content as necessary, depending on the specific figures and tables you want to include.

This will help structure your README to provide supporting information in a clear, organized way for anyone using your Julia package.
